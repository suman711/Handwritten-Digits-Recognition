# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks in Python with Keras API

### Python Libraries Used:
1. NumPy
2. Matplotlib
3. Tensorflow
4. Keras (Deep Learning API of Python)

### MNIST Dataset:
MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is probably one of the most popular datasets among machine learning and deep learning enthusiasts. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale training images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9 and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes.

### Steps:
1. Importing the necessary libraries, packages and MNIST dataset
2. Preprocessing the data
3. Creating the Model
4. Training and Evaluating the Model
5. Making Predictions
